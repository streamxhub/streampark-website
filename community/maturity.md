# Maturity Assessment for Apache StreamParkâ„¢

The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

More details can be found [here](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

## Status of this assessment

This assessment is still working in progress.

## Maturity model assessment

The following table is filled according to the [Apache Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html). Mentors and community members are welcome to comment and modify it.

| **CS10** | The project maintains a public list of its contributors who have decision power. The project's PPMC (Project Management Committee) consists of those contributors.                                                        | **Yes** See [team](https://streampark.apache.org/team) with all PPMC members and committers.                  |
| **CS20** | Decisions require a consensus among PPMC members and are documented on the project's main communications channel. The PPMC takes community opinions into account, but the PPMC has the final word.                        | **YES** All decisions are made by votes on dev@streampark.apache.org, and with at least 3 +1 votes from PPMC. |
| **CS30** | The project uses documented voting rules to build consensus when discussion is not sufficient.                                                                                                                            | **YES** The project uses the standard ASF voting rules.                                                       |
| **CS40** | In Apache projects, vetoes are only valid for code commits. The person exercising the veto must justify it with a technical explanation, as per the Apache voting rules defined in CS30.                                  | **YES** Apache StreamPark community has not used the veto power yet except for code commits.                  |
| **CS50** | All "important" discussions happen asynchronously in written form on the project's main communications channel. Offline, face-to-face or private discussions that affect the project are also documented on that channel. | **YES** All important discussions and conclusions are recorded in written form.                               |
